package Array;

//Array is a collection of similar type of data in a single variable
//to declare arrya mention the below following (DataType then Square bracet[] then
//varable name then braces
//Arrays being "homogeneous in nature" means that all
// elements in an array must be of the same data type
// String[] name = {sgh,asdx,asd}
//how many element can arrya hold
//to define the no of element that an arrya can hold we have to allocate memory for the
//arya in java

//double [[ data; --->declearing arrya
//data = newdouble[10];--->allocateing memory
//int [] age ={2,4,5,6}-->initialization arry during declaration
//useing indexes-
//int [] age = new int[5];
//age[0] = 12;
//age[1] =34;
//new is used to create a new array object in memory.
//The new keyword is used to allocate memory for the array


public class ArrayUseCase {

   public static void main(String[] args){
//    int[] age = new int[4];
//        System.out.println(age);
//the output is this ---> [I@<hashcode>
// The [ indicates that the object is an array,
// and I stands for an array of integers (int)
// @<hashcode> output mein dikhai deta hai, to ye computer ka
// tareeka hai us array ka ek alag pehchaan number dene ka.
// Ye number computer ko batata hai ki array memory mein kis jagah par rakha gaya hai.
//@<hashcode> part is just a unique number that the computer uses to
// keep track of that specific array, like a label on a box in a storage room.
